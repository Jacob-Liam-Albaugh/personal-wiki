## 2026-11-06 — setup and first ingest
- Adapted the course-vault CLAUDE.md to the whole Papers library. The topic folders are left as they are and act as the raw layer; there is no `raw/` folder. Added area slugs and paper and lecture templates.
- Set up `wiki/`, `wiki/meta/` and `notes/`, and a local git repo that tracks only the wiki, the notes and CLAUDE.md.
- Built [[sources]] from a scan of 243 files: 13 ingested, 187 queued, 35 reference, 8 Finder aliases. Two scanned PDFs have no text layer: the BJS Linear Optimization book and MIT ch. 1-5.
- Ingested 10 papers:
  - the Poly DSL paper;
  - the two reading-group papers;
  - the two lab IFT papers;
  - Wang 2026;
  - Welling-Teh SGLD;
  - three Ruqi Zhang SG-MCMC papers.
- Wrote 48 pages in total, papers plus concept pages.
- Duplicates found:
  - SGLD exists in both Bayesian/ and IFT/.
  - The PIFT arXiv preprint is in Bayesian/.
  - The DeepONet arXiv preprint is in Operators/.
- Open flags, marked **[unverified]** on the pages:
  - the SGLD noise convention in Alberts & Bilionis eq. 22;
  - the exponents of the Cyclical SG-MCMC Thm 2;
  - one term in the Low-precision SGLD Thm 3;
  - noise values in the PIFT examples.
- Plan: [notes/001](../../notes/001-library-wiki-setup-and-ingest-plan.md).
